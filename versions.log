  removed the additionnal Poisson contribution
  that was wrongly added once more to the
  sample variance new output format is
  [...] err(resampling)  err(resampling-poisson) err(poisson) [...]

  (-err subsample) for -corr number estimator

for 3D correlation functions

v 0.37
- Alexie changed the print output for g-g lensing
 from if(result.Nsources[i] > 3.0){ to
 if(result.Nsources[i] > 0.0){

v 0.36
- bug corrected for bootstrap2D and jackknife2D
- removed checkArg for "range"
- fixed bug for covariance matrix

now e2 IS the e1 rotated by 45 deg

v 0.35
- "-" error put back, but need to find a solution [see v 0.36]
v 0.34
- no "-" error
v 0.33 March 5th 2013
- added the options (-err) jackknife2D and bootstrap2D

v 0.32 Feb 15th 2013
- bug corrected in the list of options

v 0.31  Feb 7th 2013
- calibration factors, -calib [yes/no] option added
- "-corr number" option added to compute 1-pt quantities
  with bootstrap or jackknife errors
- "-rot45" option added (to compute 45 deg. lensing signal)
  for systematics tests

v 0.22 Nov 13, 2012
- Peebles estimator implemented (DD/DR, D1D2/D1R2)

v 0.2 - 0.21 Oct 21st, 2012
- w(R) implemented: -proj phys/como
- wp(rp) can be computed as function
  of physical coordinates -proj phys
- "coord" option deleted. It is assumed that
  auto_wtheta, cross_wtheta, auto_wp, cross_wp, and gglens
  all have RA DEC z as input
  auto_3D and cross_3D to be implemented soon
- implemented w(theta) and wp(rp) weights

v 0.15 Aug 21st, 2012 [Alexie/Jean]
- bug corrected for sig crit in phys coordinates
  (1+z_lens) factor was missing

v 0.14 Aug 10th, 2012
- implemented wp(rp): set -corr auto_wp
  and cross_wp for computing wp(rp)
- added -xi yes option to print out xi(rp,pi)
  in [fileOutName].xi
- removed option -cov_out, if -cov yes
  prints out covariance matrix in [fileOutName].cov
- corrected a bug in freeResult
- IMPORTANT: it seems to have a bug with
  recent versions of Mac OS Xcode and icc 11.1
  if using icc, it must be compiled with -use-asm
  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11877044

v 0.12 May 1st, 2012
- xi(r) 3D added (option -coord CART3D)
- default parameter file (swot -d) improved

v 0.11 April 4th, 2012
- data2 for sources catalogue
- more details in swot -d, -o now works
- no approx.: -OA no

v 0.1 April 3rd, 2012
- version from the old - memory monster - one.
  For previous versions, see main.c in legacy/
  option "nboots" has been replaced by "nsamples"
  and must be a power of two
